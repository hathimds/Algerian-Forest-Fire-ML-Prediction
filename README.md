# 🌲 Algerian Forest Fire – Fire Weather Index (FWI) Prediction

This project presents a complete machine learning pipeline to predict the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** using real-world meteorological data from Algerian forest fire records. The goal is to support early warning and forest fire risk assessment through accurate FWI predictions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Cleaned and processed meteorological data relevant to fire weather conditions.  
- Built a **Ridge Regression** model to predict FWI based on weather features.  
- Developed a **Flask web application** that allows users to input meteorological parameters and receive predicted FWI values in real time.  
- Successfully deployed the web app on **Render** for public access.

## ✅ Key Features
- Data preprocessing including cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.  
- Ridge Regression model trained and evaluated for robust prediction.  
- Interactive Flask interface for user-friendly input and output display.  
- Cloud deployment enabling easy access from anywhere.
