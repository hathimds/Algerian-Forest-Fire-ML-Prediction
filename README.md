# 🌲 Algerian Forest Fire – FWI Prediction (Deployed on Render)

A complete **machine learning pipeline** to predict the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** using real-world Algerian forest fire meteorological data.  
This project includes **data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment** as a **Flask web app** hosted on **Render**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Wildfires can have devastating environmental and economic impacts.  
This project uses **meteorological data** to predict the **Fire Weather Index (FWI)** — a numerical rating of fire danger.

The system:
- ✅ Cleans and processes raw weather data from Algeria  
- ✅ Trains a **Ridge Regression** model for FWI prediction  
- ✅ Provides an **interactive web interface** for user input  
- ✅ Returns real-time FWI predictions via a deployed Flask app
